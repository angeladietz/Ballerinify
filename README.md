# Ballerinify

*Ballerinify* is an iOS app developed by two current Software Engineering students and former ballerinas back in their prime.

*Ballerinify* watches a person in real-time and uses machine learning to detect key points on a person's body, and classify the dance position that the user is in.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift**
  - **AVCaptureSession** from the **AVFoundation** swift library to manage camera feed input
  - **UIKit** to build the user interface components and control the code interaction
- **TensorFlow Lite PoseNet** model to identify key points on a body
- **CocoaPods** to manage project dependencies
